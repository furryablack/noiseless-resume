# noiseless-resume

Why is this resume so brief and lacking in information?

- Please take a look at this resume - https://furryablack.github.io/resume/.

- Review the skills section.

- Review the summary and work experience sections.

- I see a senior-level professional with Bootstrap.css skills mentioned. This doesn't seem serious.

- Can I omit such obvious things? Of course, I can.

- Will I find a new project with that resume? Most likely not. The chances are significantly reduced.

- The recruiter is looking for a senior professional.

- The recruter may not be aware that someone with such extensive experience can already handle website development.

- A senior professional with his level of experience has surpassed individual libraries.

- This noisless resume will not have any fluff or noise.

- The emphasis in this noisless resume is placed on the summary section.
