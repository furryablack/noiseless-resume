        Please take a look at this resume

      <li>Review the skills section.</li>
      <li>Review the summary and work experience sections.</li>
      <li>I see a senior-level professional with Bootstrap.css skills mentioned. This doesn't seem serious.</li>
      <li>Can I omit such obvious things? Of course, I can.</li>
      <li>Will I find a new project with that resume? Most likely not. The chances are significantly reduced.</li>
      <li>The recruiter is looking for a senior professional.</li>
      <li>The recruter may not be aware that someone with such extensive experience can already handle website development.</li>
      <li>A senior professional with his level of experience has surpassed individual libraries.</li>
      <li>This noisless resume will not have any fluff or noise.</li>
      <li>The emphasis in this noisless resume is placed on the summary section.</li>
